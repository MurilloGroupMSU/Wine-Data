The classic wine data sets from the [Vinho Verde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinho_Verde) DOC in Portugal are included here, along with a preprint of the publication the data set is based on. I have also combined the two data sets into a single set that contains both red and white with an additional identifier column to distinguish the two. 

I also include a Jupyter notebook at [Gist](https://gist.github.com/MurilloGroupMSU/10ad4db2d75bd9f51feac7ae45844727) that contains some very basic statistical analyses of this data set.
